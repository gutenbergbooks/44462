Machine.</a></h2>

<p>I propose to describe a method of making an electrical
machine of small dimensions, but capable of performing all
the experiments that are likely to be required of it.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">Fig 1.&mdash;Back of Rubber, Showing Position of Hole.</p>
</div>

<p>For the stand of the machine take a piece of wood (deal
will do, but mahogany would be preferable) 14 inches in
length, 8 inches in breadth, and &#8541; inch in thickness. To
the bottom of this fasten two more pieces of the same wood,
1&frac14; inches broad, 8 inches long, and &#8541; inch in thickness
at opposite ends, so that the edges are flush with the board.
This forms our stand, on which we now proceed to erect the
machine. Take another piece of the same wood, 7 inches
long by 2&frac12; broad, and &#8542; inch thick and fasten it firmly
by four screws at the ends to the base board at a distance of
half an inch from one end of its length and in the center of
its breadth.</p>

<p>We now take two pieces of wood 14&frac12; inches long by 2&frac14;
inches broad and &frac12; inch thick, and fasten them up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>right
to the opposite sides in the center of the piece just
fixed to the board. They must be fixed very firmly to it
with several screws, as they have to bear a severe strain
while the machine is worked.</p>

<p>If the reader can <i>dovetail</i> the ends into the cross board
they will be held much more firmly. At the top of these
pieces another piece of wood, 3&frac14; inches square by &#8540; inch
thick, is fastened by screws into the upright pieces, so as to
hold all firmly together.</p>

</div>

<p>The framework of the machine is now complete, and we
have to provide the glass plate from which the electricity is
to be produced. As we cannot make this we must apply to
an electrician for it. This is 10 inches in diameter. If the
maker is good at, and has appliances for, working in brass
on a small scale, he can make the axle himself by taking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
piece of brass rod &frac14; inch in diameter and 3 inches long and
fastening the glass plate in the center.</p>

<p>This can be done by providing two circular caps of brass
one and one-half inches in diameter (the side of which next
the glass must be covered with cloth to prevent cracking the
glass), and fastening one by solder or otherwise, on one side
of the plate, the other being arranged to screw up tightly on
the other side, by having the brass turned into a screw, and
the center hole of the cap made with a flange to fit it. If
this is beyond the reader, he must be contented with a less
elaborate axle of wood instead of brass, and two wooden
caps which can be firmly fastened to the axle and glued to
the opposite sides of the glass plate with Prout&rsquo;s elastic glue,
which can be bought from any harnessmaker.</p>

<p>If this is used care must be taken in warming the glass
not to render the glue too soft to hold it firmly when turned
by the handle. To turn the axle it must be provided with a
handle of wood, in the case of the wooden axle, or, in the
case of the brass one, a handle is made by turning the projecting
end of the axle into a screw and fitting to it a piece
of flat brass three and one-half inches by one-half inch by
one-eighth inch, this latter piece having another piece of
brass rod three and one-half inches long fixed to the other
end, on which a wooden handle is fixed (by a cap fastened at
the end of the rod) so as to turn freely.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i05.png" width="424" height="164" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Shape of Brass Rod to collect the Electricity.</p>
</div>

<p>The glass plate having been thus mounted, we must turn
our attention to the rubbers which generate the electricity
on the plate. To make these take four pieces of wood 3
inches by 2&frac12; inches by &#8540; inch, and on one side of them
fix pieces of thick flannel (which you can get nearly &frac14; inch
in thickness) of the same size, and cover these over with
black silk, gluing it down lightly to the wood, so as to form
a thick cushion on one side of it. These four cushions have
now to be fixed so as to be firmly pressed against the glass
plate while it turns. This can be done by fastening them at
the backs by screws to the upright pieces supporting the
plate, or by gluing four small pieces of wood about &#8539; inch
thick, and square in shape, to the inside of the supports.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
The rubbers then have four holes cut in their backs to fit
these pieces of wood, on which they slide when placed on
the side of the glass, and are thus held firmly in position.
Fig. 1 shows the position of the holes on the backs of the
rubbers. The latter plan is the best for fastening the rubbers,
as it allows them to be removed at any time for warming
(a very essential point) or spreading fresh amalgam on
them. Fig. 2 shows the position of the plate and rubbers
when in their places.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sectional Diagram Showing Position of Collectors
and Plate.</span></p>
</div>

<p>We now have the means for procuring electricity, but the
method of collecting it has yet to be provided. To make
this a conductor must be formed by cutting a piece of
wood to the shape of Fig. 3. It should be about 6 inches
from end to end, and must be carefully rounded so that no
projections are left on it. It must then be covered carefully
with tinfoil (which can be obtained from a chemist), the tinfoil
being glued down as smoothly as possible. From the
end of this conductor a piece of brass rod should be fixed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
shaped as shown in Fig. 4. A piece about 12 inches long
will be wanted. This must be bent at the ends, so that
when the conductor is mounted on a stand consisting of a
piece of glass rod 6&frac12; inches high, fixed to the center of
the stand (that is 5 inches from the opposite end to that at
which the supports are), the glass plate revolves between
two surfaces of the brass rod. Fig. 5 explains the arrangement,
which is somewhat complicated to describe. The
glass rod should be about 7 inches long, to allow of half an
inch being inserted into a hole in the center of the conductor,
which is thus supported 6&frac12; inches high from the
stand.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i07.png" width="600" height="448" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;The Machine When Finished.</p>
</div>

<p>It now only remains to fasten several small pieces of brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
wire about a quarter of an inch long, filed to a point, to the
sides of the rod nearest the glass plate, as shown in Fig. 6,
so that the plate revolves between a double row of points,
which can be done with solder, and the machine is complete.
The conductor can further be improved by inserting at the
opposite end a small piece of brass rod two and a half inches
high, surmounted by a brass ball, which is useful in
some experiments. Care must be taken that the tinfoil of
the conductor overlaps the brass rod at either end, and thus
forms a metallic connection. If this is not done the conductor
will not become charged sufficiently. If the conductor
can be made of brass it will work better still, as a metallic
connection is then insured. The conductor can be
fastened to the glass rod on which it is supported by &ldquo;Prout&rsquo;s
elastic glue,&rdquo; or other cement, a hole being made in the center
of the bottom of the conductor, and another in the stand
of the machine for opposite ends of the glass rod.</p>

<p>The machine having been constructed, a few words will be
useful in how to work it. Warmth and dryness are, above
all things, essential. If the air of the room is damp it will
be nearly impossible to obtain any result. Before working,
the glass plate must be thoroughly warmed, taking care not
to crack it, by being placed endwise before a good fire. A
silk handkerchief is a useful adjunct to the machine.</p>

<p>The glass plate should be wiped quite free from dirt,
and the glass support of the conductor must also be wiped,
the handkerchief being made very hot. The rubbers must
be taken off (if constructed so as to be movable, as described),
and placed before the fire till quite hot. Their
powers may be enormously increased by covering them with
amalgam, as sold in the electrical shops, but a far better
plan is to cover the cushions with tinfoil, which can be glued
right round the rubbers and over the backs. This will need
renewing at intervals, as the plate in turning wears it out.</p>

<p>Now, when the rubbers are quite hot and all the glass of
the machine is dry and hot (this is necessary, because, if
damp, the electricity would escape without producing any
effect), the rubbers are put into their proper places on each
side of the glass, and on turning the handle (which will be
rendered easier if the machine is firmly clamped to the table)
and approaching the knuckle to the conductor, a succession
of brilliant sparks will be emitted from the conductor. If
this does not happen either the glass or some part of the
machine is damp, or the machine is not put together quite
correctly, and must be examined to find out the fault.</p>

<p>A machine of the size described should give a spark an
inch long when working properly. A great number of experiments
may be performed with this machine with appar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>atus
capable of being made at home. I give a final illustration
(Fig. 6) to show how the machine looks when completed.</p>

<h2><a name="How_to_Make_an_Induction_Coil" id="How_to_Make_an_Induction_Coil">How to Make an Induction Coil.</a></h2>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i08.png" width="354" height="587" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To most boys electricity offers many attractions, and as I
have recently constructed an induction coil out of materials
which are cheap and easily obtained, I think I shall confer a
benefit on many readers if I give them a short description of
how this was accomplished, so that if like-minded they can
proceed in the same way. Induction coils may be used for
medical and scientific purposes as well as for amusement, so
that a good deal of work comes within their scope. An
&ldquo;induction coil&rdquo; is composed principally of two portions&mdash;one
is the &ldquo;primary&rdquo; coil, the other the &ldquo;secondary.&rdquo; It is
the secondary coil that gives the spark, and on the length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
this depends the power of the coil; in some instruments for
scientific purposes it is composed of a wire nearly 300 miles
long&mdash;but we are not going to soar to such heights as that!</p>

<p>To make the coil itself you want an ounce of &ldquo;No. 24&rdquo;
cotton-covered wire, and two or three ounces of &ldquo;No. 36.&rdquo;
This can be bought from an electrical supply dealer. If you
are very ambitious, silk-covered wire can be used; this gives
better effect, the insulation being more complete.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;Back Disc.</p>

<p class="center">BB, holes for secondary wire. C, hole for core.</p>
</div>

<p>To form the groundwork of the apparatus take a piece of
mahogany about half an inch in thickness and polish it up
to look ornamental; it should be about 4 inches by 6 inches
for the sized coil I am describing. We now take another
piece of mahogany about &frac14; inch thick, and from it cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
two circular pieces about 1&frac12; inch in circumference; these
are to form the ends of the coil; they must each have a hole
&#8540; inch in diameter drilled in the center for the ends of the
core to pass through. In one of them, which is to form the
coil, two much smaller holes are drilled with a small bradawl
to allow the ends of the primary coil to pass through
(Fig. 1); in the other two similar holes are drilled further
from the center for the ends of the secondary coil (Fig. 2).
This having been done, we proceed to form the <i>core</i>, and
this being the most important part of the instrument, it
must be made with great care. Take a length of fine iron
wire (annealed) and cut it into pieces 2&frac12; inches long.</p>

<p>Now take a brass tube of the same size internally as the
center holes in the ends of the coil were made (&#8540; inch) and
push as many pieces of wire into it as are required to pack it
as full as it will hold. The next thing to do is to take another
piece of wire and wind it as tightly as possible round
the ends of the wires, pulling them gradually out of the tube
as you wind, until they are entirely out, by which time a
compact bundle of iron wire will have been formed. Now
file the ends of the core thus formed, quite smooth, with a
fine file, and drop the whole of it, wire and all, into the hottest
part of a fire. Leave it there till it is bright red hot
all through, and then rake it out and bury it completely in
the ashes under the grate. If this can be done over night,
and the coil left to get cold as the fire goes out, instead
of being placed in the ashes, so much the better, as the object
is to cool it as gradually, and thus make it as soft as
possible.</p>

<div class="center">

B, back of reel.<br />
C, core.<br />
PP, holes for primary wire.<br />
SS, holes for secondary wire.
</p>
</div>

<p>When it has become perfectly cold take some paraffin wax
and melt it in a dish. When thoroughly melted, heat the core
again gently, and put it into the melted wax. Leave it there
for a short time till it is thoroughly saturated with the melt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ed
wax, then take it out and hold it above the dish to let the
melted paraffin run back into it. When cold you may remove
the binding wire, and the wax will be found to hold all
the pieces together in a solid lump. The two pieces of
wood must now be fixed one at each end of the core (the
holes being the same size as the bore of the brass tube, the
core should fit into them quite tight), one of them (the front)
being pushed a little distance over the core, so as to leave
about &frac14; of an inch of the core projecting from it, the other
one only being pushed on sufficiently far to make the end of
the coil flush with the wood (Fig. 3).</p>

<p>Take a sheet of thin notepaper and cut a piece exactly the
width of the coil, and long enough to pass twice round it.
Wind it tightly round, and fasten it, if necessary, with a little
paraffin. Now the wire has to be wound on over the
paper, the thickest first, to form the primary coil. Pass
about three inches of one end of it through one of the holes
in the disc forming the front of the coil, and then wind it
evenly on the core, taking care that each coil is separate
from its neighbor, and that no two coils fall one upon the
other.</p>

<p>When the wire has reached the other end of the core,
wind it back again over the first layer till it reaches the
end it came in at, then pass it through the other hole and cut
it off about three inches from the hole; the wire cut off will
be wanted for other purposes. The secondary coil has now
to be wound over the primary, first of all saturating the
cotton with which the latter is covered by pouring melted
paraffin over it with a spoon. All the secondary wire will be
wanted; it must be wound layer above layer exactly as the
primary was, first passing about three inches of the end
through one of the holes in the disc at the back of the core.
A thickness of notepaper should be put on between the primary
and secondary coils. Everything depends on the complete
insulation of one coil from another, and this is accomplished
by means of the notepaper and cotton, saturated
with melted wax in subsequent operations. When the whole
of the secondary wire is wound on except about three inches,
pass the end through the other hole in the disc.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that the wire has not been broken
in the winding, which would entirely destroy the action of
the instrument, the two ends of the coils should be joined
separately with a battery and galvanometer. If the needle
is deflected on joining the circuit the wire is all right. This
is rather important, as it is extremely vexatious, when all
the different parts have been adjusted, to find that the coil
will not work owing to a fracture of the wire, which necessitates
the whole coil being unwound before it can be discov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>ered.
If the galvanometer is not at hand we must take our
chance; the greatest possible care must be taken in winding
the secondary wire, as this thin wire is extremely brittle.
The insulation must now be improved by plunging the whole
coil into a deep vessel large enough to contain it, which is
full of melted paraffin. This must be placed near the fire,
so as to keep the wax melted, and the coils must be left in
it to soak for an hour or two. When the paraffin has thoroughly
permeated through it it can be taken out and held
above the vessel to drain. If all the wax does not run off
the ends they can be scraped afterward, taking care not to
cut the wires. The appearance of the coil is vastly improved
by a strip of velvet cut the right width, which can be drawn
tightly and sewn in position; or the coil may be covered
with a varnish made by dissolving red sealing-wax in spirits
of wine by the aid of a gentle heat. The coil part of the instrument
is now complete, and ready to be affixed to the
base-board by means of two small screws passing through it
into the discs when placed in the proper position (see
Fig. 6.)</p>

<p>We now approach a very important and rather intricate
piece of workmanship. It is necessary, in order that shocks
should be obtained from the coil, that the current in the
primary wire should be stopped and started again at the
rate of several hundred times per minute, and the more
quickly the contact between the battery wire and the primary
coil is made and unmade the more powerful the shock.
In order to accomplish this a &ldquo;contact-breaker&rdquo; becomes
necessary, the method of making which is as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

</p>
</div>

<p>A piece of sheet brass is taken 1&frac12; inches long by about
&#8540; of an inch at one end, gradually tapered up till it comes
to a point about &#8539; of an inch broad at the other; it must
be very thin, and must act as a spring when fastened tightly
at one end. A small piece of soft iron is soldered to the
small end of this to be attracted by the core when working.
The next thing is to fasten a small piece of platinum foil
about &frac14; of an inch square on the opposite side of the brass
to the soft iron, and a little below it (Fig. 4). This is rather
a difficult operation, as it is such a small object to solder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and the best way is to get it done by a tinsmith, unless you
are skilled in the use of the soldering bit.</p>

battery by screw in opposite corner.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>A narrow strip of stout brass is now taken and bent at
right angles near one end, so that when screwed down to the
base-board by holes in the smallest leg the longest leg will
stand upright. Stand it up on the base in front of the coil
and note a point on the strip exactly opposite the core.
Make a hole through this point large enough to admit a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
screw used on paper fasteners. Now take the flange part of
the paper-fastener and solder it to the back of the brass strip,
so that the screw will work through both (Fig. 5). This is
done to avoid the trouble of making a flange in the strip, but
if you <i>can</i> do this, so much the better.</p>

<p>Now, the coil having been fastened to the base by fine
screws through it into the ends of the reel, nearly in the
center of the base, we must find a place on the base in a
straight line with the end of the core (as at C, Fig. 6), and
here we fasten another piece of bent brass similar to the last.
The end of the contact breaker is now soldered to this brass
strip in such a way that the piece of soft iron at the other
end is exactly opposite the core and about <sup class="fraction">1</sup>&#8260;<sub class="fraction">16</sub> inch distant
from it. The screw of the paper fastener must now be
tipped with platinum by cutting off the end and drilling a
fine hole in it, in which hole a small piece of platinum wire
can be soldered. The amount of wire and foil required,
although very minute, will cost you about twenty-five cents,
platinum being a very expensive substance. It can be
bought from a chemist or electrician.</p>

<p>The screw having been prepared in this way, we must next
fasten the brass strip to which the flange is soldered upright
on the base, so that the platinum point of the screw, when
inserted, will just come in contact with the square of foil on
the spring. By turning the head of the screw the soft iron
can thus be forced nearer the core, and the rapidity of its
vibration is thus controlled. The coil is now complete, except
the connections, which are made (preferably underneath
the base by letting the wires through) by joining the ends of
the thin wire to two &ldquo;binding screws,&rdquo; which are made for
this purpose and can be obtained from the dealer. One end
of the thick wire of the coil is fastened to the strip of brass
supporting the contact-breaker, the other end is fastened to
a binding-screw on one side of the base&mdash;the strip of brass
supporting the screw being connected by a wire with another
binding-screw on the other side. This sounds rather intricate,
but will easily be understood if we consider that the
current from the battery when the wires are connected with
the binding-screw must pass through the brass strip to the
screw, thence through the contact-breaker to the coil, and,
having passed round the coil, back to the battery through
the binding-screw attached to the other end of the wire. (See
Fig. 6.)</p>

<p>It is now evident that when the contact-breaker is in contact
with the screw a current will pass through the primary
coil, and will cause the soft iron core to become a magnet
and thus attract the soft iron. When this moves towards
the magnet, contact is broken and the core is instantly de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>magnetized,
so that the spring flies back and contact is made
again. The screw is adjusted so that the contact is broken
just as the soft iron touches the core. When the battery is
joined on, the contact-breaker will fly backwards and forwards
with tremendous speed, making a loud, buzzing noise,
while brilliant sparks will appear between the platinum wire
and foil.</p>

<p>In order to feel the effect of the shock, two handles will be
required; these can be made by simply bending two pieces
of tin about two inches by four inches round a ruler and
neatly soldering the joins. A wire is now fastened to the
end of each tube, the other ends being inserted in the binding
screws connected with the thin wire of the secondary coil,
which are at the opposite corners of the base to those which
are joined to the ends of the primary coil. When the coil is
buzzing, if these handles are tightly held, a powerful shock
will be felt, in fact, a weak battery only should be used with
the coil of the dimensions given, or it may be impossible to
release the handles, and this is too strong to be pleasant.</p>

<p>The current can be regulated by means of a &ldquo;regulating
tube,&rdquo; that is simply a brass tube which is made to slip over
the core between it and the primary coil; the farther the
tube is pushed over the core, the less powerful the shock.
The dimensions of the coil being the same, a little ingenuity
will enable any one to affix a regulating-tube. I will only
say that instead of winding the coil direct on the core a tube
of brown paper is formed a little larger than the core, and
on this the wire is wound. Between this tube and the core
the brass tube is arranged to slip in and out, the hole in the
end of the reel farthest from the contact-breaker being
made larger for its accommodation.</p>

<p>This concludes my description of the coil, but perhaps a few
hints as to suitable batteries may be useful. If a strong
battery which will only work the coil for a short time is
required, the bottle bichromate is a good one. It can be
bought from a dealer, or one can be made in a simple form
by taking a jar and filling it with a strong solution of bichromate
of potassium, to which a little sulphuric acid has
been added. Take two pieces of gas carbon and three pieces
of sheet zinc, both cut to the right size to dip in the solution
to the bottom of the jar.</p>

<p>At the top of the zincs and carbons bore small holes, and
below these place narrow strips of wood to keep them
apart when in use; these must be long enough to reach
across the top of the jar when the zincs and carbons are in
the solution.</p>

<p>Arrange them thus: zinc, wood, carbon, wood, zinc, wood,
carbon, wood, zinc; bind them lightly together by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
two more pieces of wood placed outside the outer zincs, and
the whole tied together with string. Connect the three zincs
together with one piece of wire, and the two carbons with
another, taking care that the wire connecting the zincs, does
not come in contact with the wire connecting the carbons.
To one zinc attach a piece of covered wire, and to one carbon
attach another, these two wires are connected with the
binding screws of the primary coil. This battery is extremely
strong, double as strong as the bottle bichromates sold,
as there are more zincs and carbons employed, but it only
lasts a short time before needing to be replenished.</p>

<p>Daniell&rsquo;s battery is a weaker form, but lasts much longer,
say for two or three hours in constant work. Take a deep
jar and inside it place a porous jar of earthenware, which the
electrician will provide. Now get a piece of sheet copper of
the right size to go into the jar, and bend it round so that
the porous jar will go inside it. A piece of sheet zinc will
be wanted to go inside the porous jar. Both zinc and copper
must be high enough to reach the level of the solutions
when the jars are full. The porous jar is filled with dilute
sulphuric acid, or solution of common salt; the jar outside is
filled with &ldquo;<i>saturated</i>&rdquo; solution of sulphate of copper&mdash;that
is, as strong as it can be made. Lumps of sulphate of copper
are kept in the outer cell, which will keep the solution
concentrated by slowly dissolving. Attach one wire to the
zinc and another to the copper, and when these are joined
to the binding screws of the primary coil the contact-breaker
will begin buzzing.</p>

<h2><a name="How_to_Make_a_Small_Dynamo" id="How_to_Make_a_Small_Dynamo">How to Make a Small Dynamo.</a></h2>

<h3>PART I.</h3>

<p>The dynamo is not the most simple piece of mechanism
extant, and I am inclined to think that many boys would
find it rather a poser to make one. At the same time it is
perfectly evident that there are heaps of our readers who are
very anxious indeed to <i>try</i>, at all events, and as we must aim
at more elaborate apparatus as we advance in electrical
knowledge, it is a pity not to endeavor to supply them with
the help they need.</p>

<p>Well, then, if, like Pears&rsquo; soap baby, they &ldquo;won&rsquo;t be happy
till they get it,&rdquo; I will do my level best to bring down the
subject into the range of their capability. It will not cost
them much to try the experiment, and if they don&rsquo;t succeed
they must not blame me, but their &ldquo;vaulting ambition,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which has &ldquo;o&rsquo;erleapt itself.&rdquo; There is no reason whatever
why a boy who is accustomed to metal working should not
succeed in making the small machine described if he first
masters the principles of its construction.</p>

<p>The advantage of a dynamo, I may here remark, is that
by its means we are able to produce a current of voltaic
electricity at any moment by turning a wheel without bothering
with acids or carbons, or zincs, or any other of the
various articles necessitated by the use of a battery.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the current goes on as long as you turn the
wheel, and stops directly you stop, there being no loss between
whiles. Of course, both battery and dynamo have
their advantages and disadvantages&mdash;nothing in this world
being perfect all round&mdash;and for some purposes the dynamo
is best, for others the battery. For example, it would be
absurd to use a dynamo to ring an electric bell&mdash;not that it
would not do it with tremendous energy, but in the case of
a bell what one wants is merely to ring it for a few seconds
at long intervals, and for this work a battery in which there
is little current, but which is always ready to give that little
without touching it, is <i>facile princeps</i>. But for experiments
in which a strong continuous current is required, the dynamo
comes to the front, as there is no &ldquo;polarization&rdquo; to detract
from its value, as in the case of the battery. One does
not always want to be messing with chemicals in setting up
a battery, when one only requires the current for a short
time, and the dynamo is always ready, and merely turning
the handle produces the required current in a moment. Besides
this, viewed merely in the light of a magneto-electric
machine, it will give a considerable shock to any one who
holds two handles fixed to its terminals.</p>

<p>Having now enumerated the advantages of the machine, it
behooves me to endeavor to describe its various parts and
the method of making them. There are several methods of
dynamo-making, but that which seems to be the most used
and most easily followed in the case of a small machine, is
that of the type known as the &ldquo;Siemens&rdquo; dynamo, from the
inventor of the armature, which is of peculiar construction.</p>

<p>The action of the dynamo depends on the fact that if a
piece of soft iron is surrounded by a coil of insulated wire,
when the soft iron is approached to a magnet it becomes itself
a magnet, and at the same time a current is generated
in the coil of insulated wire which surrounds it. This current
is, however, of only momentary duration, and ceases if
the soft iron remains stationary; but on removing the soft
iron from the magnet another current is generated in the coil
of wire, but this is a current of the opposite kind of electricity,
and travels in the opposite direction to that produced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the former case. Now you have only to imagine that, by
means of rotating in front of the poles of a magnet, a piece
of soft iron is kept continually approaching and receding
from the magnet, and that this soft iron is surrounded by
wires in which circulate currents positive or negative according
to the direction of the movement of the soft iron, and
then, if we can arrange to carry off all the positive currents
to one binding-screw, and all the negative currents to another
binding-screw, we shall have a continuous current
generated as long as the soft iron revolves. All this is practically
carried out in the construction of the dynamo, and
on the accuracy with which it is done the efficiency of the
dynamo depends.</p>

<p>To make the base of the machine, take a piece of deal
5&frac12; inches long by 3&frac12; inches broad by &#8542; inch thick.
This can be stained afterwards to make it look nicer; it
must be planed well and polished up quite smooth.</p>

<span class="small">A</span>, One side of hole for armature.</p>
</div>

<p>The greatest difficulty of the whole business has now already
to be confronted&mdash;viz., the manufacture of the magnet.
This is almost invariably cast in two pieces, and for those
who cannot make the castings there is no help for it but to
have recourse to the ironmonger, or, better still, a practical
electrician. The following instructions will then assist you
to put the castings together:</p>

<p>Supposing this difficulty to have been overcome, and two
pieces of soft iron to have been cast in the form of Fig. 1,
both exactly the same size and shape; the next thing to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
is to convert it into an electro-magnet by winding seven
layers of No. 16 cotton covered wire over each leg, at the
part shown by the dotted lines in the illustration.</p>

<p>The size of the legs of the magnet is as follows:&mdash;Total
length from <span class="small">B</span> to <span class="small">C</span>, 4&#8539; inches; thickness of top piece from
<span class="small">B</span> to <span class="small">D</span>, &frac12; inch; length of top piece from <span class="small">B</span> to <span class="small">D</span> (half total
length of top of magnet), &frac34; inch; breadth of side of magnet
all the way down, 1&frac34; inch; height from <span class="small">E</span> to <span class="small">C</span>, 1&frac12; inch;
thickness of the part between <span class="small">D</span> and <span class="small">E</span>, round which the wire
is wound, &#8540; inch. When I say &ldquo;breadth&rdquo; in this description,
I mean what you can&rsquo;t see in the sectional drawing,
because it recedes from you; when I say &ldquo;thickness,&rdquo; I mean
what is shown in the drawing. It is necessary to explain
this, as the terms are rather confusing. The ends of the
sides between <span class="small">D</span> and <span class="small">E</span> are rounded to admit of the wire being
more evenly wound on them.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not essential to use a permanent magnet in this machine,
as a certain amount of &ldquo;residual&rdquo; magnetism remains
in the iron when once excited; and the coils of wire
on the armature being acted on by the armature, which is
slightly magnetized by this residual magnetism in the magnet,
have a reactionary effect, and excite the armature,
which excites the magnet afresh; and thus the magnet and
<i>its</i> coils, and the armature and <i>its</i> coils, go on acting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
each other, and mutually building up each other&rsquo;s current,
until the maximum effect which the machine is capable of
giving is produced.</p>

<p>Before winding on the wire, the legs of the magnet between
<span class="small">D</span> and <span class="small">E</span> should be covered with a band of silk soaked in melted
paraffin wax to increase the insulation. New and soft
wire, of the highest conductivity, should be used. Old, rinky,
and hard wire will not do.</p>

</div>

<p>The wire is wound upon the legs of the magnet in such a
way that when put together as shown in Fig. 2 the coils are
in opposite directions, so that if the magnet were straighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>ed
out, or the two portions placed end to end, one coil would
be a prolongation of the other. This can be most easily
done, in the case of this particular magnet, by winding each
leg separately, and the end of the outer coil of wire of one
can be joined to the end of the inner coil of wire of the other
at <span class="small">D</span> in the cut, the other ends of the coils being left loose as
at <span class="small">E</span> and <span class="small">F</span>, these being long enough to go down under the
base&mdash;say, about 3 inches long to allow for joining up.</p>

<p>The electro-magnet having been wound, may now be
placed upright on the base, its two limbs fastened together
by a screw at <span class="small">A</span>. The magnet is now to be fastened to the
base in the middle of its breadth, and about an inch from
one end, by means of two screws at <span class="small">B</span> and <span class="small">C</span>, passing
through the base into the legs of the magnet. Before it is
fastened on, however, you had better drill two screw holes
on each leg at <span class="small">H H H H</span> in the figure, and four corresponding
to them on the other side. We shall want eight screws to fit
these holes presently.</p>

</div>

<p>The magnet having been fixed, we now have to construct
the armature, which is the next most important part of the
machine.</p>

<p>This consists of a soft iron cylinder with an axle passing
through its center, as at <span class="small">K L</span> in the illustration (Fig. 3), <span class="smcap">S S S
S</span> being the soft iron cylinder. This cylinder has a deep
groove cut from end to end, or is cast in that shape, and
round this groove the wire is wound. The wire is number
18, cotton or silk-covered. Begin at the point marked <span class="small">H</span> in
the diagram, and wind over and over, from end to end, until
that side is full; then cross over to the other side, going
from <span class="small">H</span> to <span class="small">R</span>, and wind that side also in the same direction.
The ends of the wire are shown at <span class="small">W W</span>, and they must be
left about an inch or two inches long, as we shall want to
connect them with the commutator presently.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the armature are as follows: Length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
axle, 5&frac12; inches; circumference of cylinder, 1 inch; length
of cylinder, 2 inches; width of groove, &frac34; inch. The axle
is composed of a piece of steel rod rather more than &#8539; inch
in diameter. The axle must be very truly centered in the
armature, and the armature must be accurately mounted, as
it has to revolve at a high rate of speed in a very limited
space, between the poles of the magnet.</p>

<p>As it is rather difficult to explain the construction of the
armature, I give another illustration (Fig. 4) of a section of
the armature, which will show how the wire is wound on the
groove, and the shape of the grooves themselves.</p>

<p>At one end of the axle is fixed the driving-pulley <span class="small">P</span>, while
at the other has to be fixed a small wooden roller <span class="small">F</span>, over
which two pieces of sheet brass have been fastened, each
reaching nearly half round the surface of the roller, so that
two gaps are left between them. This forms part of the
commutator; but before we come to that we must consider
how the armature is to be fixed between the poles of the
magnet.</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p class="center">The dotted lines show position of holes for screws and axle.
<span class="small">P P</span>, Holes for screws.</p>
</div>

<p>Returning to Fig. 1, we must see that the groove <span class="small">A</span>, which
forms half the channel in which the armature is to revolve,
is &#8542; inch semi-circle. When the two sides are fixed together
as in Fig. 2, the hole between the poles should be
about an inch in circumference, and the wire must be wound
on the armature so that it easily slips into the cavity <span class="small">G</span>,
which must be made quite smooth for it to revolve in. It
will be seen from the dimensions given that in diameter the
armature is only a little less than the cylindrical space between
the poles of the magnet, and in length it is about the
same as the width of the magnet. It would be an unfortunate
occurrence if the wire was to slip off the armature while
revolving at a high speed, and therefore it is necessary to
keep it firmly in its place. This is done by filing four small
notches in the soft iron of the armature at the points marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
<span class="small">A B C D</span> in Fig. 3. Some strong wire or small string is now
wound lightly round the armature to hold the coils of wire in
their proper place, the notches holding this wire or string
from slipping off at the ends of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The armature is now to be fixed in its proper place between
the poles of the magnet.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="center">The dotted lines show position of holes for screws and axle.
<span class="small">P P</span>, Holes for screws.</p>
</div>

<p>To do this we shall want two supports for the axle. These
are made of brass, shaped as in Figs. 5 and 6, 5 being the
one at the pulley end of the axle, and 6 that at the other end.
They are fastened by screws through the holes <span class="small">P P</span>, into the
holes <span class="small">H H H H</span> in the bottom part of the side of the magnet,
as previously shown in Fig. 2.</p>

as Fig. 7, this being a sectional diagram from above,
and the top pieces of the magnet being omitted for simplicity&rsquo;s
sake.</p>

</div>

<p>The brass of which the supports are made should be about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
&#8539; inch thick, and must, of course, be drilled in the center
with a hole to admit the axle of the armature. To keep it
exactly in the right place while revolving, a piece of circular
brass tube, with a bore the size of the hole made to admit
the armature, should be soldered to the brass supports in
front of the hole; that for the pulley end of the axle should
be &frac12; inch long. One at the other end is not necessary, but
looks neater; this may be about &frac14; inch long&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> as long
as the end of the axle projecting beyond the brass support.</p>

<p>This much having been accomplished, we have now to
consider the &ldquo;commutator,&rdquo; which is a piece of apparatus
by which all the currents proceeding from magnet and armature
are sent in one direction, and thus, instead of counteracting
each other, are made available for experiments.</p>

</div>

<p>To make this necessary adjunct to the dynamo, take a circular
bar of brass rod about &#8540; inch in diameter and an inch
long. Into the middle of this solder a brass screw by drilling
a hole and inserting its upper end <i>minus</i> the head. On
this screw works a brass nut about &#8540; inch long. At the
other end of the rod a hole is drilled for the insertion of another
brass screw, long enough to go through the base.
Another pillar precisely like this has now to be made, only
&frac12; inch high without the nut. Now cut two pieces of sheet
brass 2 inches long and &frac12; inch broad, sufficiently stout to
act as springs and not too stout to be elastic. At one end
of each cut a longitudinal hole about &frac34; inch long and &#8539;
inch broad; that is to say, this slit must be broad enough
to slip over the top of the screws above the pillars. At the
other ends of the brass springs slits of equal length, but
very narrow&mdash;only about <sup class="fraction">1</sup>&#8260;<sub class="fraction">24</sub> inch wide&mdash;may be cut, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
make the brass more &ldquo;springy.&rdquo; On the under side of this
end of one spring and the upper side of the other, two
pieces of thin sheet copper are fixed, the same breadth as the
springs, and about &frac12; inch long. These are soldered by
one end to the side of the spring, so as to act as springs
themselves, their other ends being free.</p>

<p>All this being rather complicated, we must invoke the
aid of the engraver once more. Fig. 8 gives you the method
of making the pillars&mdash;<span class="small">A</span> being the brass rod, <span class="small">B</span> the screw
and <span class="small">C</span> the nut, the hole to admit screw to fasten the pillar
to the base is made at the end <span class="small">D</span>.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 is the brass spring with slit, <span class="small">A</span>, to slip over the
screw of Fig. 8, and the copper spring soldered to one side,
at the end, at the point <span class="small">B</span>. Now we slip the brass spring
over the screw, the screw coming through the slit, and
screw down the nut <span class="small">C</span>. We thus have two springs supported
at the ends on pillars at a height of 1 inch and &frac12; inch from
the base respectively. Of course, both the pillars and springs
are treated alike, but in the case of the tallest the copper is
on the <i>under</i> side, and in the other on the <i>upper</i> side.</p>

<p>Now we go back to the armature, on the axle of which
you will remember that I told you to fix a small roller of
wood. This is only &frac34; inch long and &frac12; inch in diameter,
and is fixed firmly to the axle so as to revolve along with
the armature. This roller is soaked in melted paraffin wax
for an hour or two before fixing on, or boiled in it for some
time, so that it may permeate the wood. The roller can
easily be turned (of boxwood, preferably) if you are possessed
of a lathe, but if you have none, go to the nearest
photographer (or, preferably, a dealer in photographic apparatus),
and from him you can buy for 3 cents a roller long
enough to cut dozens for dynamos&mdash;they are what sensitized
paper is sold rolled on.</p>

<p>The roller having been provided, take a piece of brass tube
exactly so large inside that the roller will fit tightly into it,
and cut off a piece the same length as the roller, or, if anything
a trifle shorter. You have now to cut, with a saw or
otherwise, two diagonal lines in this tube lengthwise, so
that the tube is thereby divided into two pieces. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
done this the brass is replaced on the roller and fastened by
minute screws, or &ldquo;Prout&rsquo;s elastic glue,&rdquo; to each side of it,
so that the roller becomes practically one of brass, with two
slits in it. The screws must not project above the brass,
but must be well sunk into it, so as to leave the surface
smooth: and care must be taken that the screws do not
touch both pieces of brass by going right through the roller&mdash;they
must be very short. The object of cutting the slits in
a diagonal direction is that the springs when pressing above
and below the roller (see Fig. 10) shall not leave one half of
the commutator before resting on the other part. If they do
so the commutator will &ldquo;spark&rdquo; badly, which injures the
fittings, and less current is obtained. Both slits are to be
equidistant, and both inclined in the same direction. The
roller is fixed on the axle in such a position that the middles
of the lines of division are exactly in a line with the middle
of the groove of the armature. When all this has been accomplished
you will obviously have two conducting surfaces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
each reaching over half the cylinder, separated by a small
distance at top and bottom, the paraffined wood, of course,
being a non-conductor of electricity. The brass tube must
be made to fit smoothly round the wood, the surface being
free from any irregularities, so that the contact with the
springs at the sides may be as perfect as possible. Care
must be taken that the brass is really separate all down on
both sides. It is a good plan to fasten small splinters of
paraffined wood in the slits to make sure.</p>

<p>This having been done, the wire from one end of the coil
of the armature must be soldered to one of the semi-circumferences
(if I may coin a word) of brass on the wooden roller,
and the wire from the other end of the coil to the other semi-circumference.
This is done at the end or underneath, not
at the top, or it will make the surface rough, and we want
it to be as smooth as it can possibly be. The wire must be
quite tight up to the end soldered on; there must be no
loops, or it will catch in something and be torn off when it
comes to revolve.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Section of Commutator Put Together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="small">P P</span>, Pillars supporting springs, <span class="small">S S</span>, which bear respectively
on the upper and under sides of the roller, which is covered
with brass except for the slits shown in the diagram.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The brass pillars supporting the springs have now to be
inserted in the base, at such a distance, one on each side of
the roller covered with brass, that the copper springs at the
end of the brass ones are exactly one over and one under the
brass roller. Of course, if they are put in a line with it, the
springs can easily be shifted to the right position by slipping
the slits over the screws of the pillars, and screwing down
the nuts lightly when they come to the right place. This is
very difficult to make intelligible, and I give another illustration
of the relative positions of the parts of the commutator
which I hope will make all clear. The pillars <span class="small">P P</span>&mdash;which
were put together as shown in Figs. 8 and 9&mdash;are fixed at
such distances on opposite sides of the roller <span class="small">R</span> that the
springs <span class="small">S S</span> are continually in contact with the brass semi-circumferences,
first one and then the other as the armature
revolves.</p>

<p>We are now within sight of the end of our task, and to
guide off the current that we are going to produce we must
screw in two binding-screws at opposite corners of the same
end of the base (the end at which the commutator is). The
ends of the wire from the magnet are to be brought down
through the base and joined to the under part of these binding-screws.
Placing the base so that the commutator end of
the armature, and not the pulley end, is next to you, the
wire from the inner coil of the magnet goes to the binding-screw
on your left hand, and that from the outer coil to that
on your right hand. The magnet should be wound and
placed in such a position that these ends are respectively on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the left and right, and then they have only to be joined to the
binding-screws in front of them.</p>

<p>But before connecting these wires up, it is necessary to
give an initial magnetism to the magnet, which at present
has not been magnetized at all! To do this we must make
use of another dynamo or a battery and connect the wires
coming from the magnet-coil to the terminals of the battery.
This having been done, the magnet will attract iron filings
or needles, etc., and this shows that it has really become a
magnet. Two cells of the chloride battery will be enough to
magnetize it as much as it can be magnetized, and enough
will remain when the battery is disconnected to start the
action when the armature is revolved. Two or three minutes
is long enough to connect with the battery.</p>

<h3>PART III.</h3>

<p>While the current is passing you can try the following
experiment, to prove that the wire is wound on all right. If
it is not wound as described there will be two north poles or
two south poles, instead of one north and one south. Suppose
we decide to make the leg on which the wire comes
from the outside of the magnet the north pole, the wire from
this must be joined to the wire coming from the zinc end of
the battery, and the other coming from the inside, between
the poles, joined to the wire from the carbon end. Now if,
while the current is passing, a magnetized needle is approached
to each pole consecutively, and one end of it is attracted
and the other repelled in each case, the wire is all
right; if both are attracted something is wrong. The needle
must have been really magnetized beforehand, or it will deceive
you; you can easily test if it is so with an ordinary
permanent magnet.</p>

<p>Having magnetized the soft iron in the way described, we
now join up the wires to the binding screws, under the base,
and, the pulley being fixed on to the axle of the armature opposite
to the commutator, the machine is now ready for use.
To rotate the armature at a high speed it is necessary to
connect the pulley by an endless band with a large, heavy
wheel which can be rotated by hand.</p>

<p>For continuous work, as we cannot always be turning the
wheel, a small steam-engine or water-motor must be employed.
Worked in this way, the machine I have described
can be made to light 2 5 candle-power lamps of 6 volts, and
give about 12 volts of current. This is not much, of course,
but by enlarging the proportions of the various parts, you
can make as large a dynamo as you like; only the power
required to work it naturally increases considerably. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
machine will do a great deal of the work of a battery&mdash;for
example it will run an induction coil or an electro motor at
full power. By connecting two brass handles to the binding-screws
by wires, you will get a powerful shock if you hold
them while some one turns the wheel connected with the
pulley; in fact, the shock is too powerful, and the person
turning the wheel must be prepared to stop when the victim
has had enough. If these handles are dipped into a glass
of water slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid (to enable
the current to pass more freely), and the dynamo briskly
turned, you will soon see bubbles rising from the handles&mdash;which
must, of course, be placed separate from each other&mdash;consisting
of oxygen and hydrogen gas, into which the water
is being decomposed by the force of the current. Water being
composed of two quantities of hydrogen gas to every one
of oxygen, it follows that double as much hydrogen will
come off the handle which evolves it as will come off the
other of oxygen, and this you will soon see to be the case;
the bubbles on the former being much more numerous than
those on the latter.</p>

<p>Now take a 5 candle-power 6-volt electric lamp, and fasten
it on to the wires coming from the binding-screws (removing
the handles) by the platinum loops at the top. If
the dynamo is now briskly turned, you will find that the lamp
will light up well, and as long as the wheel is turned and the
dynamo is buzzing, so long will the lamp continue to glow.
By turning the dynamo by steam or water-motor we have,
therefore, a means of producing a continuous light, which
will not drop at the end of a few minutes as in the case of a
battery. This is the method by which all public buildings,
etc., are lighted.</p>

<p>There is said to be always sufficient residual magnetism in
the soft iron core (at any rate if constructed of ordinary soft
iron, not specially annealed) to act on the armature when
revolved, and this, acting on the magnet, increases its magnetism
so that they react on each other until the maximum
effect of the dynamo is reached. This is the case with the
majority of dynamos used for lighting, etc.; but if you are of
an experimental turn of mind, and are possessed of a battery
as well as the dynamo, you can try the effect of magnetizing
the soft iron cores by sending a current from the battery
through the coil.</p>

<p>To do this, disconnect the wires from the magnet-coil from
the binding-screws, and connect them with the terminals of
the battery. The whole current from the dynamo now comes
from the armature, and you will find that this current is considerably
increased, sparks flying about in all directions
when the handles from the binding-screws are approached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
each other or rubbed together. The water will now be decomposed
much faster, and you will be able to light an additional
lamp or two, according to the strength of the battery.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 gives an idea of the positions of the parts of the
dynamo when complete; it is not an easy thing to draw, and
I can only hope the rough sketch will be intelligible to my
readers. The spring <span class="small">A</span> is below the roller of contact breaker,
and the spring <span class="small">B</span> above it, the diagonal line on the roller
representing the vacancy between the brass pieces covering
the wood. The wires from the ends of the magnet-coil go
through the base, round the bottoms of the pillars <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">B</span>,
and join the other wire between the pillars and the binding-screws.
The wire from the pole on which the wire comes
from <i>outside</i> the magnet is joined to the binding-screw <span class="small">A</span> in
the figure. The other wire comes from between the poles,
and is joined to the other binding-screw. If you can find
out, by means of a galvanometer, which binding-screw is
conveying the <i>positive</i> current, the wire from the <i>south</i> pole
of the magnet is to be joined to the wire from this, and that
from the <i>north</i> pole of the magnet to the wire conveying the
<i>negative</i> electricity.</p>

</div>

<p>Whenever you join the wires, be sure to scrape off all the insulating
material, and twist them firmly together; a little solder
is an improvement. Whenever the wires cross the iron work
be sure the insulating material is quite sound at that point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
It is a good plan to roll paraffined silk round the wires at
these places. Cut grooves under the base, in which the wires
may lie, or the dynamo will not stand evenly. The dark
line in the middle of the top of magnet in Fig. 11 shows
where the two parts join. They should be screwed up tightly
together.</p>

</div>

<p>As a concluding illustration, I give a diagram of my own
method of turning my dynamo (Fig. 12). On the leg of an
ordinary table <span class="small">T</span> is fixed the heavy iron wheel <span class="small">W</span>, which has a
groove cut in its circumference for the reception of an endless
band <span class="small">B</span>. These wheels may be obtained for a few shillings
from any ironmonger, as they are made for various
machines, such as laths, fret-saws, sewing-machines, etc.
The wheel is held by an ordinary screw fixed into the leg of
the table, and revolves on the screw. The endless
band (tape will do) passes over the groove and over the pulley
of the dynamo placed on the table above the wheel.</p>

<p>It is better to let the pulley of the dynamo project beyond
the end of the base, as shown in Fig. 11, in order to be able
to connect it with a wheel placed below it, if required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The best results are produced from the dynamo when the
resistance of the interpolar (<i>i. e.</i> the lamp, or whatever it
may have to work) is equal to the internal resistance of the
machine. It is sometimes required to send a current
through a greater resistance than this, and then it becomes
necessary to employ what is familiarly termed a &ldquo;shunt.&rdquo;
If one lamp of high resistance is coupled to the dynamo, the
resistance may be too great for the current to get round the
magnet in sufficient quantity to give the required electromotive
force. Supposing that this is the case, we make a
second pathway for it by joining on a piece of iron wire
(about ten inches of No. 30) between the two binding-screws,
the lamp being connected with the same binding-screws,
only further off. The result of this is that the current goes
round by the second pathway and excites the magnet more
powerfully, and this, in its turn, excites the armature more
strongly, and so on, until enough current is produced to
light up the lamp. The resistance of the shunt required depends
on the resistance of the lamp. If this is low no shunt
will be required, if very high the resistance of the shunt must
be lowered, or else enough current will not pass to magnetize
the soft iron cores, and the dynamo will give no current.
The lower the resistance of the shunt required, the less wire
we use.</p>

<h3>PART I.<br />
THE ELECTRIC TRUMPET.</h3>

<p>There are many toys which one meets with in the scientific
stores, the making of which for themselves would give
great satisfaction to enterprising devotees of the electrical
art. They are for the most part easily constructed, and a
great deal of amusement can be derived from them. I have
my doubts whether the fathers and mothers of the amateur
electrician will thank me for introducing the subject of the
present article, but they must take comfort in the thought
that if it works well it shows real constructive power on the
part of the maker.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those whose capability of working in
metal is limited, I am first going to describe the making of
this remarkable instrument in its simplest form&mdash;a form, in
fact, so simple that any one can make it and achieve success
in a few hours.</p>

<p>First of all we want an old tooth-powder box. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
all made the same size, and consequently it is unnecessary
to give dimensions. The top of the tooth-powder box is to
be taken, and by means of a fretsaw (this invaluable tool
should be in the hands of every boy who likes carpentering;
there are many uses to which it can be put quite different
for what it is intended for) a circular hole is to be cut out
about &#8539; inch less than the inside&mdash;that is to say, a rim of
about &#8539; inch is to project all around from the rim of the
lid.</p>

<p>We now want what is known in photography as a &ldquo;ferrotype&rdquo;
plate&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, a piece of very thin sheet iron. Most
dealers in photographic goods will not sell less than four or
five dozen of them, and this is too many for us. A photographic
friend will let us have one gratis, or a professional
photographer <i>may</i> agree to part with one for five or ten
cents if he is attacked when in a good temper.</p>

<p>The ferrotype plate having been procured by some means
or other, the next thing is to cut from it a circle just small
enough to go inside the rim of the top of the tooth-powder
box. You can mark out the circle before cutting it by painting
the top of the rim of the bottom of the tooth-powder box
with ink and pressing it down on the ferrotype plate, when
enough ink will come off to guide the scissors, and of course
the circle so cut will be the exact size required.</p>

<p>We now have to make the motive power of the machine,
for there is plenty of work done in it, though it only makes
a noise&mdash;no one can &ldquo;make a noise in the world&rdquo; without
doing plenty of work! And to make this we take a piece of
soft iron rod about 1&frac12; inch long and half an inch in diameter,
and cut two circles out of cardboard 1&frac34; inch in diameter.
The soft iron rod can be bought from any hardware
store, and it ought to be quite soft enough to work at once
without doing anything to it; if it is not, it must be heated
red-hot in a good fire and left among the coals over-night to
get cool very gradually.</p>

<p>Personally I have always found that the ordinary bars of
soft iron bought from any hardware man are amply soft
enough for any electrical work.</p>

<p>You must get the hardware man to file the ends of your
bar flat; if they are not filed you will have to do it yourself,
and a fine job it is!</p>

<p>Now we go back to the circles of cardboard. A hole is to
be cut in each in the center exactly the size to admit the core
of soft iron, then by slipping the circles over the ends we get
a reel. Now a hole has to be made exactly in the center of
the bottom of the tooth-powder box, and exactly so large
that the core of soft iron will fit tightly into it; you can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
this again with the fretsaw, the wood of which tooth-powder
boxes are made is delightfully easy to cut.</p>

<p>Now comes the adjustment of the reel. You must put the
circles on the core, and putting one end of the latter through
the hole at the bottom of the box you must push the iron
through until the top is exactly flush with the top of the rim
of the side of the box. One of your circles will now be much
further on the core than the other, and the one at the end
that is not pushed through the hole must be adjusted close to
the edge, leaving about <sup class="fraction">1</sup>&#8260;<sub class="fraction">16</sub> of the core projecting, so that
we have now a reel formed at one end of the core, and held
in position by the bottom of the box. The more stiffly the
core fits the hole the better, and if it has to be hammered
into its place, better still, only take care not to split the
wood of the bottom of the box.</p>

<p>The circles, being now in their right places, must not be
moved again, but the roller has to be wound with wire, for
which purpose the core will have to come out of the box
temporarily. Before beginning to wind the wire, get some
thin paper (French note-paper is best), and wind a piece
round and round the core between the circles, fastening it
and the circles at its ends to the core by means of a small
quantity of mucilage.</p>

<p>We now have to wind the wire on to the roller. The more
wire the stronger the magnet will be, but sufficient will be
about two ounces. You can get the wire at most hardware
stores for fifteen cents an ounce. It is generally cotton-covered,
of light green color; medium thickness should be
used, not too fine, as this offers too much resistance to the
current, and not too coarse, or it will fill the reel too soon.</p>

<p>We begin by making a hole near the core in the circle
which is furthest on it, and push one end of the wire
through a hole from the inside of the reel. About three
inches should be pushed through to allow for future manipulation,
and the wire is now to be wound tightly over the
paper covering the core in even coils, layer on layer, till the
reel is nearly full and we have arrived at within about
three inches of the other end of the wire. This is now to be
passed through another hole in the same circle as before,
which hole will of course be further from the center than
the first. The magnet will be much stronger if two or
three folds of paper are wrapped round it between each
layer of wire.</p>

<p>The coil is now constructed, and can be replaced in the
tooth-powder box, passing the ends of the wire through two
holes in the side or bottom made to receive them. Before
leaving this part of the instrument I may remark that care
must be taken that the covering of wire is quite continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
throughout, and has not got rubbed off at any points; if it
has, you must wind fine silk over it to cover it up again.
Should there be a break anywhere in the wire you must
carefully scrape the wire off the two ends and twist the
wires firmly together, if possible soldering them together
and then wind fine silk over the join.</p>

<p>It is not necessary in this machine to soak the coil in
melted paraffin, but might improve the insulation if the cover
of the wire is thin. Only if there is a join and you have
twisted, not soldered the wires together, you must not soak
the coil in wax, or the melted wax gets between the ends of
the wires and stops the current (this of course applies to all
electro-magnets and should be remembered as a possible
cause of failure.)</p>

<p>The core having been pushed through the hole again, up
to the circle of cardboard, the ferrotype plate is placed in the
top of the box, and the box is shut up. Now the ferrotype
plate must be exactly free of the end of the core and that is
all. You can test this by tapping it. If it vibrates in and
out, it is all right; if the end of the core is too tightly pressed
against it, there will be no possibility of moving the center
in and out, and the core must be driven further through the
hole till it is just free of the ferrotype plate.</p>

</div>

<p>Now comes another part of the instrument, viz., the contact-breaker.
The following is as good a way of arranging it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
as any: Take a piece of sheet brass the exact length of the
diameter of the top of the tooth-powder box and about half
inch wide, and in the middle of it bore a hole which will admit
a brass screw&mdash;with a milled head preferably. The screw
should fit tightly into the hole, so as to screw easily up and
down when turned. To the end of the screw, which is cut
off flat, is soldered a short piece of platinum wire, inserted in
a hole in the end of the screw made to receive it; it can be
fastened by any other means, as long as it will screw up and
down and is in contact with the brass screw. Adjust the
screw so that the platinum point is within a minute distance
of the ferrotype plate when the brass support is screwed
down at the ends to the side of the box lid, and screw it
down with small screws firmly in its position.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>Before this is done, however, a thin strip of platinum foil
should be soldered to the upper surface of the ferrotype
plate, or otherwise fastened to it&mdash;elastic glue will answer&mdash;this
strip terminating in the center, and reaching to the edge
of the plate, leaving a short piece over. A very thin strip
will be enough, of the shape of <span class="small">P</span> in Fig. 1. Now the ferrotype
plate is to be placed in position again (the side of which
the platinum foil is fastened being outwards, and the end of
the foil going down between the edge of the ferrotype plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and the wood into the inside of the box), and the end of the
wire from the coil which was left inside the box is to be securely
fastened, either by soldering or otherwise, to the end
of the platinum foil which was left loose, so as to be in metallic
connection with it. A wire can now be twisted round
or soldered to the screw with the platinum point, and the instrument
is complete.</p>

<p>It has taken some space to describe, but I made my own
in about half an hour. Fig. 2 gives a general view of the
parts put together.</p>

<p>The lid of the box should be tightly fastened down by four
small screws, two of which may be those which fasten on the
brass strip holding the screw.</p>

<p>Now to consider its action. The wire <span class="small">I</span> in Fig. 2 is connected
to one wire of the battery, and the wire <span class="small">G</span> to the other.
The current then starts from the battery, round the coil <span class="small">B</span>,
converting the core into a magnet, and up the wire <span class="small">H</span> to the
platinum foil <span class="small">P</span>, along the platinum foil, which was fastened
to the upper side of the ferrotype plate <span class="small">F</span>, to the platinum
wire which tips the screw <span class="small">C</span>. It then goes up the screw <span class="small">C</span>,
along the brass piece <span class="small">E</span>, which is fastened to the box by
screws, as shown in the figure, to the wire <span class="small">G</span>, and so back to
the battery by the other wire.</p>

<p>The screw <span class="small">C</span> must be therefore screwed down till the platinum
wire at its tip is just in contact with the foil on the ferrotype
plate. Now of course when the current goes round
the coil, and thus converts the soft iron into an electro-magnet,
the latter instantly attracts the ferrotype plate
which is immediately above it. But the latter moving its
center near the core, the platinum foil which is attached to
it is thereby moved out of contact with the wire on the
screw <span class="small">C</span>, and the current is instantly stopped. Thereupon
the attraction of the magnet ceases, and the ferrotype plate
flies back to its former position and so joins the platinum
wire and foil, and starts the current again, and the former
process is repeated. The ferrotype plate therefore vibrates
with tremendous rapidity between the core and the platinum
screw. Now the vibrating armature of an ordinary coil
makes quite a hum when hard at work, but of course a large
plate such as this makes a much louder noise, consequently
you will hear a ferocious buzzing like an army of millions of
bees let loose from a hive, and on screwing the screw <span class="small">C</span> up
or down till you get to the correct point you will get a shrill
note very like a penny whistle. If screwed up the vibrations
are slower, and a deeper note is produced; if screwed down
the vibrations are more rapid and a higher note is sounded.
Therefore you can amuse yourself by screwing it rapidly up
and down, or adjusting it by pressing the brass piece with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
your finger, and a little practice will enable you to bring
out a sort of tune produced by electricity!</p>

<p>When you have become tired of jingling out your tune you
can fix the electric trumpet up in a permanent position, adjusting
the wires from the battery so as to pass through an
ordinary &ldquo;press&rdquo; which may be in another room. The
trumpet will then begin buzzing or hooting whenever the
button of the press is pushed in, and stop when the pressure
is released. In this way of course the trumpet will act
as a &ldquo;call&rdquo; instead of a bell, and as the double wire can be
easily hidden under the carpet and in dark corners, and
painted to match whatever wood-work it crosses, you can
arrange it from an up-stairs room to a down-stairs one or <i>vice
versa</i> with very little trouble. I give an illustration of the
method of connecting the battery and trumpet with one
switch or &ldquo;press,&rdquo; to show how to arrange the series. (See
Fig. 3.)</p>

</div>

<p>The trumpet made in the very simple way I have described
will not produce a very loud noise, but quite loud enough, if
properly put together, to attract a person&rsquo;s attention who
was in the room when it went off. The sound can be rendered
louder by fixing a cardboard funnel or &ldquo;cornucopia&rdquo;
to the front of the tooth-powder box to make a kind of horn.</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p>The trumpets sold in the shops, as a rule, make a very
loud noise indeed&mdash;in fact, a little of it goes a very long way
with most people. The increased sound is probably due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the body of the trumpet being composed of brass, which,
vibrating in unison with the ferrotype plate, increases the
sound. Wood will therefore not give so loud a sound, and
if you can construct the case of metal you should certainly
do so. The vibrations of the plate, and therefore the sound,
may also be increased by using a horseshoe magnet, the two
poles attracting the plate more strongly. In the bought
trumpets the case is shaped like a horn, in which the magnet
is placed, the platinum contact-breaker being behind
(where it is in the one I have described, supposing there was
no bottom to the box and the magnet was supported by a
bar across from side to side, the cornucopia being placed on
that side of the box, instead of the other, with the magnet
inside it). I think it is unnecessary to describe their construction
further, as the principle and details of construction
of the simple one I have described will apply to any, and any
method of structure may be adopted which suits the mind of
the maker.</p>

<p>The trumpet having been made I will now give you a plan
of fitting it up which adds enormously to the effect. We
want to hide the trumpet so that no one shall know where it
is. My own plan of doing this is as follows: I have made a
wooden erection, of which I give a drawing which will explain
itself. It consists of a back with a shelf at the bottom
and a kind of canopy at the top. It can be made almost any
size, small or big, to suit the occupant of the shelf. My own
measurements are about as follows: From the top <span class="small">A</span> to the
bottom <span class="small">B</span>, the length of back piece, including bracket, 1 foot
3 inches. Breadth of back 5&frac14; inches. Side of canopy (<span class="small">D</span>),
breadth 4&frac12; inches, height 3&frac12; inches, breadth of front
(<span class="small">C</span> to <span class="small">D</span>) 5&frac14; inches; height of course the same as sides.
The top piece will then be about 5&frac14; inches by 4&frac12; inches.
The shelf at the bottom is about the same size as the top of
the canopy, and is supported by a bracket of rather thick
wood, which you can carve as elaborately as you like.</p>

<p>Now take the electric trumpet, whether made at home or
purchased, and fasten it to the under side of the canopy
(this is best done before the sides are put on), and fasten a
double wire behind the back (cutting a groove for it to go in)
up to the back of the canopy, where it goes through and divides,
one wire being fastened to one terminal of the trumpet
and the other wire to the other. The double wire goes right
down the back and emerges at <span class="small">B</span>. Obviously if you now join
your press and battery on to the double wire, when you
squeeze the press the trumpet will squeak. But here we are
going to practice a little innocent deception, and to that end
we go to a toy shop and purchase a small and pretty doll of
the male sex, and if you can get one (or dress one up) at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>tired
as a soldier or trumpeter, by all means do so. The doll
is now to be fixed on to the bracket by means of a long
wire&mdash;say a hairpin bent out straight, one end being pushed into
the wood, the other passing up one trouser leg of the doll
and into its body; the wire is thus completely hidden and is
much better than glue, as it admits of the doll being placed
in a natural attitude, and being removed if required. In one
of his hands you must make him hold a small trumpet (this
is a very expensive item; it will cost two cents) with the
mouthpiece to his mouth, as represented in the picture.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i30.png" width="196" height="495" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Electric Doll.</p>

<p class="center">(Letters as referred to in text.)</p>
</div>

<p>The whole thing is now fastened to the wall in a convenient
place, by driving nails through the back, and the
double wire is completely hidden by passing it behind furniture,
books, etc., down to the floor. There is great scope
for ingenuity on the part of the worker in hiding the wire,
and no definite instructions can possibly be given. In my
own case I have no back piece below the shelf the support
being against the wall. The wire descends behind the support
(to <span class="small">B</span> in the picture), and below that I have hung a
&ldquo;date calendar&rdquo; over it, it makes a turn to the right and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
goes down behind a chiffonier covered with books to the
floor. Under these circumstances no human being could
possibly tell that there was a wire at all, and there being no
back piece under the bracket (so that the paper of the room
can be seen), nothing but the support touching the calendar,
it does not look as if any wires could possibly be hidden
anywhere.</p>

<p>Now, if you press the button, of course the trumpet
squeaks, but the doll being just underneath it, and the trumpet
being in the dark under the canopy, no one thinks it is
a separate instrument, but of course every one jumps to the
conclusion that it is the doll blowing! Hide the battery in
a corner in a black box, the wires coming through the side next
the wall, and the press in a dark corner, or on the
floor under a table so that you can put your foot on it while
your hands are free, writing, etc.</p>

<p>You can of course now tell the doll to blow, at the same
moment putting your foot on the press, when the trumpet
blows accordingly. Of course this is mysterious to the last
degree to the uninitiated friend to whom you are displaying
the doll, as you may be any distance off from the doll with
your hands free, speaking to him across the room.</p>

<p>The wooden erection to hold the doll can be painted any
color; preferable the back should be <i>black</i>, as it shows off
the doll. In front of the canopy you can paint a monogram
or heraldic device. If the doll is one of those extremely
pretty little specimens which can be procured at any good
toy shop for about twenty-five cents, dressed as base ball
players, soldiers, etc, (what our grandmothers would have
thought of them in their young days it is difficult to imagine)
it will really be quite an ornament to the room, independently
of its electrical qualities.</p>

<p>This chapter has outgrown the space I meant to occupy,
and I must wait for the next to tell you how to make the
doll work from various parts of the room as you walk about
and talk to him, and how to make the battery. The best
battery to use is to <i>Leclanche</i>. You can use three or four
cells of No. 2 size according to length of wire through which
the current has to pass.</p>

<p>In my next chapter I will try and explain how to make an
electric <i>drum</i>, so that you can have a kind of drum and fife
band.</p>

<h3>PART III.<br />
THE ELECTRIC DRUM.</h3>

<p>In part two on the &ldquo;Electric Trumpet,&rdquo; I promised to
explain how to make an electric drum; and this promise I now
propose to redeem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The system on which it works is precisely analogous to
that of the electric trumpet, and almost identical with that
of the ordinary electric bell, of which I hope to say more in
another chapter.</p>

<p>As before, we have a hammer vibrating backwards and
forwards in response to pulls from a magnet, which is magnetized
and demagnetized by stopping and starting an electric
current. In the case of the induction coil, the hammer
is only a means whereby the current is broken and started
again with great rapidity, and in the case of the trumpet the
vibrator is used to make the noise by its vibration, but in
this instrument we must have a <i>bona fide</i> hammer, which
must be able to beat the drum, and thus cause a stirring and
martial sound.</p>

<p>First, then, we will devote our attention to the construction
of the magnet. In former chapters (as in the case of the
electro-motor for example), I have given you the method of
making the magnets out of one solid piece of soft iron, in the
form of a horseshoe. This time, however, we will make it of
several pieces, for a change; it is far more convenient to
make, and looks much neater when finished.</p>

<p>Take a piece of soft iron 1&frac12; inches long by &#8541; inch
broad and &#8539; inch thick, and in the middle drill a hole about
<sup class="fraction">3</sup>&#8260;<sub class="fraction">16</sub> inch in diameter. On each side of this, on a line with
it at a distance of about &frac14; inch, drill two more holes of the
same size. This is to form the back, or, as it is scientifically
termed, the yoke of the magnet. To form the poles we require
two exactly similar pieces of soft iron bar 1&frac12; inch
long and &#8540; inch in diameter. These are to be filed quite
smooth at the ends after cutting, and in the middle of one
end a hole is to be drilled to admit a screw which will just go
through the holes on each side of the center one made in
the flat piece of the soft iron. These holes are cut to receive
the thread of the screw, but if you can&rsquo;t do this
you can simply leave out the end holes for screws, and solder
the round and flat pieces of iron together. These are to be
soldered or screwed together, so as to form a magnet, the
hole in the middle of the flat piece serving to introduce a
screw, for the purpose of attaching the magnet to a support.
The best plan, if you can do it, is to drill and &ldquo;tap&rdquo; this
hole to receive a screw which is inserted in a brass support
made of a piece of brass 1&#8539; inch long, &frac12; inch broad, and
&#8539; inch thick, bent at right angles at about &frac12; inch from
one end, this shortest end being drilled for two screws to
fasten it to the base-board, while the longest end has a hole
in the center about &#8539; inch from the end, to admit the screw
which fits the hole in the center of the yoke. Having done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
all this, you will have Fig. 1, which represents the magnet
before it is wound.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>The soft iron cores have now to be converted into magnets
as usual, and here comes in the especial advantages of having
screws to fasten the magnet together, as you can take
the whole thing to bits, wind the wire on the legs in comfort,
and then fasten together again. But if you have soldered
the magnet together, you can achieve the same end in a different
way by making two small bobbins to hold the wire, the
exact size to slip on over the soft iron cores when the wire
is wound on them. It is generally considered proper to wind
the wire on bobbins, which can be removed from the cores
if required. I should think it can seldom be required, but
the bobbins are convenient in this case. I may remark
parenthetically that bobbins wound and unwound, soft iron
cores, and yokes, separately or together, and supports fixed
to the yokes or not, can be obtained from any large electrician
who sells parts of electric bells, etc.; the magnet can
also be got put together complete.</p>

<p>We now have to make bobbins, supposing that we are not
going to buy them. The elaborateness of their manufacture
will depend entirely on the skill of the maker. Some construct
them by sawing off top and bottom of a reel of cotton,
and forming a roller of cardboard to fit the magnets, finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
joining the ends of the reel to this roller, to make an elongated
reel of the right size. Others construct their bobbins
entirely of cardboard, the ends being merely two circles of
card. Others who are versed in the mysteries of wood-turning,
and are lucky enough to possess a lathe with which to
do it, make two bobbins of solid wood, drilled to fit the iron
cores. For these no instructions are needed, as the dimensions
will be as given presently. For those who only want
to use the magnet for this special purpose, and do not care
about the bobbins being removable, the following is the simplest
way to set to work:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i32.png" width="366" height="392" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;Magnet Wound and Put Together.</p>

holes for screws. <span class="small">E</span>, Joined ends of wires. <span class="small">F F</span>, Exterior
ends of coils. The arrows show relative directions in which
the two coils are wound.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Cut two circles of thick cardboard, each &#8542; inch in diameter,
and in the center cut a hole the exact size to slip over
the soft iron core. Now wrap several thicknesses of thin
tissue paper&mdash;or preferably French note paper or tracing
paper&mdash;over the magnet, between the circles of cardboard,
cutting the strip about 1&#8539; inch broad or &#8540; inch less than
the length of the cores. Now you can fasten the two circles
of cardboard at the ends of the tracing paper, and keep them
in their proper places on the magnet by means of mucilage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>&mdash;beat
the soft iron before applying, and it will then adhere
firmly to it. In this way, of course, you form a roller, on
which we now have to wind the wire. If you have soldered
the magnet&rsquo;s parts together, you must have movable bobbins,
as it would be simply impossible to wind the wire evenly
on the cores when fixed in position, as the edges of the
bobbins will be so close together that it is not possible to
wind the wire on between them without the coils becoming
displaced.</p>

<p>The method of winding the wire is simple enough. No. 24
wire is a good size to use; it can be cotton-covered or, preferably,
silk-covered, as in the latter case the insulation is
better. Begin by making a hole near the roller in the circle
of cardboard that is next to the end where the hole for the
screw has been made. Pass about three inches of wire
through the hole and then wind it evenly on over the tracing
paper from end to end and back again. You ought to have
five or six layers of it; an ounce, or an ounce and a half,
of wire will probably be enough. When it is all on, make another
hole in the disc and pass out the wire. This is only to
hold it safe while you wind the other bobbin. When that is
finished you can put the magnet together, and ends of the
two wires have now to be joined together. The two ends
that are joined together must be those which come from the
wire that is wound from the right to the left over one core
and left to right over the other, that is to say, taking the wire
when joined as one, it must be so wound on both limbs of
the magnet that if they were bent into one straight bar it
would all be wound in the same direction.</p>

Holes for screws to support.</p>
</div>

<p>With a composite magnet, however, there is no earthly
difficulty in getting it right, for you have only to connect
the battery to two wires and join the other two, and if they
don&rsquo;t make the magnet work, join up one to the battery instead
of one of those joined, and connect the other two wires;
whichever gives the best result stick to. You must get all
the silk or cotton off the wire, where you join them, and
twist them over and over tightly together; if you can solder
them, so much the better. Pull the wire tight and wind it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
on the reels until the place where it is joined is pulled tightly
and not left in a loop, which would look untidy. Fig. 2 gives an
idea of the magnet completed, and I have endeavored by
means of the arrows to show how the wire is wound, they are
supposed to give the direction of the top layer of wire in each
case; of course either may be wound from the inside, so you
must also consider that in this picture the outside coils are
joined. The magnet having been thus constructed, we must
now turn our attention to the vibrating hammer which is to
beat the drum. To make this we want another piece of soft
iron of about the same size as that forming the yoke of the
magnet, say, 1&#8540; inch × &frac12; inch × &#8539; inch. We shall then
require a piece of brass spring about three inches long and
half an inch broad. This is made of very thin springy brass,
so as to make a spring which will move the armature quickly.
One end of the spring should be tapered off as shown in Fig.
3, and at the point <span class="small">P</span> in the figure a small piece of platinum
foil (the real thing, not tin-foil, which I am sure is often sold
in cheap apparatus instead of it,) should be fastened, by
solder if possible.</p>

</div>

<p>We now want a piece of rather stout brass wire bent into
the shape shown in Fig. 4. It must be about four inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
long, but its length will be determined by the size of the drum
and the length of the magnet when it is all put together. At
the end of this wire you must have a wooden knob (not brass,
which doesn&rsquo;t produce nearly so much noise). This you will
have provided ready for you if you purchase the drum, as they
will naturally supply drumsticks with it, and the head of one
of these cut off and fastened to the end of the wire, by simply
making a hole and sticking it in, will answer the purpose
beautifully.</p>

<p>This wire has to be fastened to the soft iron armature, a
simple way of doing which is to drill a hole the exact size
and insert the end; it can then be soldered in. Or, if you
cannot drill a hole, you can simply solder it on. The brass
spring has the end bent outwards, as shown in Fig. 4, and is
fastened to the soft iron armature by screws, as shown in the
figure at <span class="small">S S</span>, or simply soldered on. The point <span class="small">C</span> is the end
that is tapered off, and the platinum wire is fixed at that
point; the spring should extend about 1&frac14; inch beyond the
armature at the other end. Two holes are drilled in the
spring at the points <span class="small">H H</span>, through which screws are passed
into the support. This support may be either a piece of iron
&frac12; inch long, &frac34; inch broad and &frac34; inch thick, or a piece
of wood will answer very well, and save drilling holes in the
iron. If it is wood it had better be larger, say &frac34; inch by
&frac34; inch by 1&frac14; inch.</p>

<h3>PART IV.</h3>

<p>We can now proceed to fasten all the parts together. We
must have a piece of hard wood for the base, about 3&frac12;
inches by 3 inches and &#8540; inch thick. On this the magnet
has to be fastened by its support being screwed firmly down.
In front of it the armature has to be fastened at such a
height as to be exactly in front of the poles of the magnet.
The relative positions of the parts are shown in Fig. 5, so I
do not think a detailed account of their exact positions on
the base is at all necessary.</p>

<p>There is, however, one piece of the mechanism in the
figure to which I have introduced you, this is the contact-screw
shown at <span class="small">C</span>. To make this we take a piece of brass
about 1&frac12; inch long, &frac12; inch broad, and rather less than
&#8539; inch thick, and bend it at right angles, so that one leg is
one inch long and the other &frac12; inch. Now in the part that
is &frac12; inch have to be drilled three holes to fasten it with
nails or screws to the base. The other part, one inch long,
will then stand erect, but before fastening it in its place we
put it to stand in front of the magnet and mark a point
which is exactly on a level with the piece of platinum foil on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the spring, when the spring and magnet are fixed in position.
A hole has now to be drilled through that point and tapped
to admit a brass screw with a milled head, and fix the piece
in which the screw works to the front hole, so that the screw
will work through it.</p>

bottom when fixing into the drum.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The point of the screw has now to be cut off and a very
small piece of platinum wire fixed at the end. This wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
will now come in contact with the platinum foil on the
spring, when the brass support is fixed in a certain position
on the base, and it is now to be fixed in that position with
screws or nails. It should be so fixed that when the screw
is turned till it is nearly out of its hole the wire is just out of
contact with the platinum foil on the spring. It is now evident
that by turning the screw one way you make the spring
vibrate more rapidly, and by turning it the other way its
efforts are relaxed.</p>

<p>The contact-breaker screw having been fixed in its place,
and the support of the spring also fixed as at <span class="small">T</span> in the diagram
(Fig. 5)&mdash;by screws through the base into the iron, if
it is made of iron, or by nails or screws through it into the
base if of wood&mdash;all the parts are now together, and all that
remains to be done is to make the necessary connections.
One wire that comes from the magnet is to be joined (soldered,
if possible,) to the spring at <span class="small">H</span> in the picture; the other
wire is left loose. To the brass support of the contact screw
we solder another piece of wire. Now this piece of wire is
connected with the zinc of the battery and the other (coming
from the coil of the magnet) with the carbon of the battery.
What happens?</p>

<p>The electricity passes along the wire <span class="small">X</span>, we will say, and
round the magnet coils, thus turning the cores into magnets.
It then goes down the other wire to <span class="small">H</span>, up the brass spring,
along the screw, and down by the brass support to the other
wire, by which it returns to the battery. That is to say, it
<i>would</i> do all this if the armature stood still, but, of course,
when the cores become magnets they attract the armature,
which instantly moves towards them; this breaks the circuit,
the spring moving off the platinum point of the screw, and
the armature springs back again, which makes the circuit
complete and the magnet attracts it again, and so on. The
object of the spring is to get a good deal of vibration, and
it and the screw should be so adjusted that although the
armature is close enough to the magnet to make it certain
to &ldquo;go off&rdquo; directly it is meant to do so, yet there may be
as much scope for the spring to work with elasticity as possible.</p>

<p>We have now completed the electrical part of the business,
but a slightly necessary part of the apparatus has yet
to be obtained&mdash;viz., the drum. You can easily make a
drum if you like, by taking a broad piece of tin, twisting it
round to form a hoop, and covering the ends with parchment
strained tightly over them. However, I should certainly
not do so, for there can hardly be any spot, I should
think, which boasts of a toy-shop at all, where drums cannot
be procured! For twenty-five cents you can get a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
superior drum, just about the right size; if you like to get a
bigger one and make the mechanical part bigger, you will,
of course, be rewarded by more noise.</p>

<p>Now, suppose you have got a 25-cent toy-drum, you must
proceed to take off one end. If you look at the construction
of the drum you will find (at least it is the case with my
own, and I have not seen any that are differently made) that
by cutting one of the double strings that fasten the wood
hoops at the top and bottom together, and then loosening
all the other strings with your fingers, the wooden hoop at
one end will come right off, if the nails fastening the ends
together are taken out, and that then the inner hoop on
which the parchment is stretched will also come off and leave
that side of the drum open.</p>

<p>Now, this is simply grand for our purpose, for when we
have arranged our little dodges inside the drum, we can put
on all the hoops again, replace the one double string, and
no one will be an atom the wiser. If you could get off the
side without breaking any strings it would save the trouble
of replacing any, but I am afraid this is hardly possible.
However, off comes the side of our drum, and what is to be
done next? Well, the &ldquo;beater&rdquo; must be put bodily inside
the drum, just so close to the parchment side that was taken
off that the wooden head of the drumstick touches it when
attracted by the magnet. You can easily find the right
place in actual practice by setting the beater going and finding
the spot inside the drum where it kicks up the worst
racket when working. It must not be too close or it will
hinder the vibration, and we want the hammer to go off instanter
when required. The beater is fixed to the side of the
drum with its side marked <span class="small">Z</span> in the figure (5) downwards. It
is easily fastened there by making two holes in the wood (in
the thickness of it), and two corresponding holes in the
metal side of the drum, and then screwing it down in its
proper place.</p>

<p>Two holes are to be made in the side of the drum and two
ornamental bits of silk-covered flexible copper conductor let
through. They can be secured by simply tying knots inside
the drum, and the copper ends are now to be fastened, one
to the wire <span class="small">X</span> and the other to the wire <span class="small">K</span> from the contact
screw support. Having done all this and made sure that
the beater works when the ends of the flexible cord outside
the drum are connected with the battery, we seal up our
drum again, and that is then concluded.</p>

<p>Now as to fixing it up, I think I may fairly assume that
you know how to make it work by an ordinary battery and a
&ldquo;press.&rdquo; It is only necessary to run a double wire from
battery to press and from press to drum, one wire of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
double conductor being fastened to the carbon end of the
battery and the other to the zinc end, and the other end of
one wire to one of the wires coming from the drum. The
other wire coming from the drum is then joined to the bottom
conductor of the press, and the upper conductor of the
press is joined to the other wire of the double conductor that
goes to the battery. It is all very easy to understand if you
follow the course of the current and consider that it has to
pass through the drum and the press when the latter is
pushed down, and be stopped when it is left to spring up
again.</p>

<p>But the more magical arrangement can be made with the
drum, and I think it is well worth while to do it, if merely
for the fun of mystifying people. The drum is going to be
suspended by the flexible cords; therefore, let them be the
same length, and cutting off all the coverings at the end of
each, fasten a brass &ldquo;eye&rdquo; to the copper, twisting the wire
well round the bottom of the eye. Now wind silk of the same
color as the rest all round the join, so that the connection of
wire and eye is completely hidden, and the eye appears
merely fastened to the flexible cord as a means of suspending
the drum. Now we want to construct a hook from which
the drum can be hung.</p>

<h3>PART V.</h3>

<p>Take two small pieces of brass wire about an inch long,
and turn up the ends of each into a hook. Now get a minute
piece of ebonite of the same length, and, putting one
hook on one side and one on the other, bind the whole together
with silk. If you cannot get ebonite easily you can
use a small piece of sealing-wax in the same way; by heating
the wires you can sink them into the wax and so make a
neater join. Now the wires must not touch each other anywhere,
but must be completely separated by the ebonite or
sealing-wax. The double wire from the battery and press is
now fastened, one wire to the press hook on one side, and
one wire to that on the other side of the sealing-wax or ebonite.
Wind silk over the whole to cover the joins, and a
neat double hook is the result. The picture (Fig. 6) gives the
method of making the hook, and it also gives a great deal
more, which I now proceed to explain.</p>

<p>Supposing we can rig up a small beam of wood from
which to suspend the drum, we can make matters more mysterious
still. Let the double wire, being hidden by some
means or other all along its course, be conducted on to the
end of the beam. It can then be trained along the top of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
until it comes to the point from which the drum is to hang.
Here there must be a hole drilled, large enough to admit
the hook rather tightly. Pull the double wire through and
fasten the two wires to the hooks as before described.</p>

<div class="center">

The beam is, of course, shown in section.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Now you can pull back the wire and fix the hook firmly in
the hole, hiding the double wire at the top of the beam (of
course if it is high up no one will be able to see over the
top of the beam, so you will be quite safe); the hook being
thus fixed will not attract any one&rsquo;s notice, and look quite unsuspicious.
The chief glory of the double hook thus constructed
is, of course, that you can remove the drum whenever
you choose, for examination, and whenever you hang it
up you have only to hitch one eye over one side of the hook
and the other over the other side, and the drum will work.
People who are not up in the matter cannot conceive how
the electricity can get to the drum, when it is simply hung
by an (apparently) ordinary cord and ordinary eyes to what
looks like an ordinary hook attached to a beam in a plain
and straightforward manner.</p>

<p>You are now possessed of an electric trumpet and an
electric drum, which you can put one at one end of the room
and the other at the other. By running double wires from
battery and press to the trumpet, and another double wire
from battery and press to the drum, you can arrange matters
so that when you put one press down the trumpet
works, and when the other press is put down the drum
works. If you want to work both together you must either
have a very powerful battery (say 6 or 7 cells, No. 2 Lechlanche)
or two batteries, one for trumpet and one for drum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
If you want to use one battery for both you can make
either work (at different times) from the same battery and
presses, wherever they may be, by having a two-way switch
in a dark corner of the wire.</p>

The arrows show the course of the current when the switch
is at <span class="small">A C</span> and <span class="small">A G</span> respectively.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>It is very confusing business setting up the wires so as to
produce the right effect, which is to change the current from
drum to trumpet and <i>vice versa</i> in a moment by merely
altering the handle of the switch. Readers who are not
accustomed to the work will find it most intricate, and as I
have done it myself several times, they may as well have the
benefit of my trouble. I therefore give an illustration of
how to connect up the wires (Fig. 7), and hope it will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
matters clear to them. An explanation of the picture is
necessary.</p>

<p>Suppose first of all that the switch is at <span class="small">A C</span>, then the current
will travel from the right-hand end of the battery, <span class="small">B</span>, up
one wire of the double conductor to the press, <span class="small">P</span>, as shown
by the lower arrow, through the press and along the wire,
as shown by the top arrow, to the middle of the switch, <span class="small">A</span>,
down the arm of the switch to <span class="small">C</span>, up one wire of the double
conductor to the drum, and down by the other wire to the
other end of the battery.</p>

<p>Now let the handle of the switch be moved to the other
terminal, as shown by the dotted lines. The current will
now go from the right-hand end of the battery to press and
center of switch as before, it then goes down the arm of the
switch up to the trumpet by the wire on the left side, and
down to the other end of the battery by the wire on the right
side, as shown by the arrows. Therefore when the arm of
the switch is at <span class="small">A C</span> the press will work the drum; when it is
at <span class="small">A G</span> the press will work the trumpet.</p>

<p>Suppose we have no press, but instead of it we have only
one wire going straight from the right-hand end of the battery
to the middle of the switch. Now let two incandescent
lamps be substituted for the trumpet and drum. When the
arm of the switch is at <span class="small">A C</span> the current goes straight up
from the right-hand pole of the battery to the center of the
switch, along the arm, up to the lamp on the left-hand side,
and down to the other pole of the battery. Now, suppose
the arm of the switch is moved to <span class="small">A G</span>, the current will go
up as before to the center of the switch, down by the arm,
up the wire to the lamp on the right-hand side, and back to
the battery by the other wire. In the first case, therefore,
the lamp at <span class="small">D</span> lights up, in the second case the lamp at <span class="small">T</span>
lights up. The wires from <span class="small">C</span> to <span class="small">D</span> and <span class="small">G</span> to <span class="small">T</span> may be as long
as you please, you can therefore control the lamps when they
are far apart or in different parts of the house. When the
arm of the switch is central neither lamp lights up, or, if you
are fitting up the trumpet and drum, the press will not work
either when the switch is in this position. This is an advantage,
as when people get too inquisitive you can turn off the
current, and then whatever they do they will not make the
trumpet or drum work till you turn it on again, which you
can do when you want them to work for you!</p>

<p>The construction of the switch is so simple that it is hardly
necessary to explain the method of joining the wires, but
I may say that one is to be joined to the bottom of the brass
pillar in the center which supports the brass arm. The
others are joined to the right and left terminals, generally
by brass screws under the base, but sometimes by screw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
terminals at the upper surface; this depends on the make of
switch which is purchased.</p>

<p>Ingenious readers can easily make a switch for themselves;
it only requires a brass arm attached at one end to a central
figure, and long enough to touch two screws, or pieces of
brass, fixed to the base on opposite sides of it, when turned
in their direction. The end of the arm not supported by the
brass pillar is provided with a small wooden handle to turn
it by.</p>

<p>The switch should be arranged to occupy some dark corner
in which you can turn on drum or trumpet to work from
the &ldquo;presses&rdquo; at will without any one seeing you alter it.</p>

<p>I will only add one thing in conclusion, and that is, that
you can have the double wire from the battery and center of
switch to the press at the end as long as you like, and it can
turn about behind furniture or under the carpet as much as
you like, and it will still work instantly from the end press.</p>

<p>Now, by scraping the wire clean at any intermediate
point, or as many points as you like, and arranging a simple
spring contact fastened to the wires without breaking
them so that they can be made to touch when required and
spring apart directly the touch is removed (this is easily
done with two springs consisting of two strips of sheet
brass, one fastened to one wire and one to the other, separated
by a piece of wood except at the end when pressed
together), you can make the trumpet squeak or the drum
roll at any part of the room you like. The springs can be
hidden under the carpet so as to be absolutely undiscernible
except to the initiated. The best places are under furniture
with rather long legs; the foot of the operator can then be
placed on the springs, and so make them meet and the
trumpet or drum sound without the least chance of detection.
The wires not being broken in fixing the springs as described,
those springs which are closer to the battery, in no way interfere
with those which are further off, as, when these are
used, the current simply runs round those that intervene between
them and the battery, without being in any way hindered
in its course, and the press at the end of the double
wire will, therefore, work just as if no intermediate springs
existed.</p>

<h2><a name="Simple_Electrical_Experiments" id="Simple_Electrical_Experiments">Simple Electrical Experiments.</a></h2>

<p>Frictional electricity is pre-eminently a winter amusement.
Not that it is not equally possible to produce the
same result in summer, but then other occupations are forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
upon us, while in the long winter evenings, with a good fire
to dry the air of the sitting-room, the conditions are particularly
favorable to electrical phenomena. If a hard frost
sets in the conditions will be still more favorable, as this
dries the air and the ground outside, while on a wet evening
a large fire and warmer room will be needed to produce
as good results.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i38.png" width="284" height="233" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Electric Windmill or Tourniquet.</p>
</div>

<p>The following experiments are given as a means of
amusement to those who know little or nothing of electrical
phenomena. Some of them may be recognized by some
readers as being standard experiments, others may possess
the charm of novelty. To many, however, the whole series
will be new, and it is hoped that these will find a new source
of interest opened to them, and that they may possibly be
impelled thereby to investigate further concerning the causes
of what they see. Frictional electrical machines can be
purchased from any electrical instrument makers, at a small
price, and with these experiments mentioned are more
readily performed. In this article I only mention experiments
that can be performed with materials to be found in
every house, or the necessaries for which can be procured
from a shop for a nominal sum. Friction between two substances
of any sort probably always produces electricity; but
it can only be made visible under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>For instance, if a stick of sealing-wax is warmed and rubbed
with a piece of flannel also warm, they both become
electrified. This may be proved by holding the wax near
an electrometer, which is simply a bottle through the cork
of which a wire is passed which has two pieces of gold leaf
fastened to its extremity, when the leaves at once diverge
owing to the repelling force of the electricity. The flannel
is also electrified, but the electricity soon escapes, through
the hand of the operator to the ground.</p>

<p>We now proceed to make a simple experiment on the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>duction
of electricity on a larger scale. Take a piece of
stout brown paper and hold it in front of a hot fire till all
the moisture inherent in it is expelled, and the paper is dry
and quite hot. Now take it away suddenly, and holding it
against the side of the coat rub it briskly with the sleeve by
holding the sleeve in the hand. Take it away and hold it
against the wall of the room, to which it will instantly adhere
firmly, this adherence being caused by the development
of electricity over the surface of the brown paper by
the friction it has undergone. The paper can be removed
from the wall, and on holding it at a short distance will fly
towards it and adhere again. In a short time, however, the
electricity departs, and the paper falls to the ground. If the
hand is spread open upon the paper as it sticks, the electricity
departs at once and the paper falls. A spark can be obtained
from the paper, but it is hardly strong enough to be
visible. In the next experiment, however, it is plainly to be
seen.</p>

<p>Take an ordinary tea-tray and place it on the top of four
glass tumblers, which must have previously been made quite
hot and dry at the fire. They must also be scrupulously
clean, as dirt is a good conductor of electricity. Now take
a sheet of foolscap paper, and heat it strongly at the fire until
perfectly dry, as the brown paper was. Place it while hot
flat on the table and rub it from side to side, from the top to
the bottom, with a piece of thick india-rubber. It will now
adhere firmly to the table on account of the electricity developed.
Take hold of two corners, pull it up, and quickly
place it on the tray. On approaching the knuckle of your
closed hand to the edge of the tray you will now obtain a
brilliant spark, which, if the room is dark, will appear vivid.
On removing the paper from the tray, and again approaching
the knuckle, another spark will pass, but not so bright
as the former. The experiment can be repeated as often as
wished by heating and rubbing the paper again.</p>

<p>Now take four more tumblers, heat them as before, and
place them on the floor with a board on the top of them.
Let someone stand on this board, taking care that he is completely
separated from all surrounding objects of furniture,
etc., and that his clothes do not touch the table while the
experiment is performed. Let him place his hand on the
tray while the paper is heated, rubbed, and placed thereon.</p>

<p>He will then become charged with electricity, and if he approaches
his hand to any one else&rsquo;s a spark will pass between
them. (This should not be done with susceptible parts of
the body, the eyes for example, as it would be rather painful.)
Let some one be provided with a spoon in which a little
methylated spirit is heated; if the charged person holds his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
knuckle to this spirit it will instantly be ignited. Small pieces
of paper&mdash;comic paper figures, etc.&mdash;will dance up and down
briskly if he holds his hand outspread over them while lying
on the table. The same thing will happen if the pieces of
paper are placed between the tray and the table when the
former is charged by the hot paper, or if the brown paper in
the first experiment is held above them when excited.</p>

<p>Now take a needle and place it on the tray, its point projecting
over the edge. If the room is now darkened, on
placing the excited paper on the tray, the point of the needle
will be seen to glow brilliantly for some seconds. This is
caused by the electricity escaping into the air from the point
of the needle, and is known as the &ldquo;brush discharge.&rdquo; The
tray will consequently speedily lose its electricity. It will
be found to be impossible to get a spark from the tray as
long as the needle is on it, as the electricity vastly prefers
to escape by the point. The escape of the electricity may
be rendered still more evident by means of the following
piece of apparatus.</p>

<p>Take two pieces of thin wire about two inches long, and
bend each at right angles about an eighth of an inch from
each end, both the bent portions being in the same direction.
These two pieces of wire are now to be joined together at
the middle at right angles by means of a piece of finer wire
twisted around them. This finer wire can, with a little care,
be caused to form a small cap, in which the point of a needle
is inserted, the needle acting as a pivot, so that the bent
wires turn freely on top of it (Fig. 1). The needle is supported
by thrusting it into a large cork to act as a stand.</p>

<p>A fine wire is then twisted several times around the bottom
of the needle, and the whole apparatus is then placed
on the tray, the end of the wire attached to the needle being
carefully arranged so as to touch the tray, a metallic connection
with the tray being essential to success. If the
needle can be soldered to a metal stand, or the cork covered
with tinfoil, the wire is not needed. On rubbing the paper
and placing it on the tray, the electricity passes up the wire
into the needle, thence into the wire cross, and escapes by
the bent portions of the wires, each of which should be filed
to a point. In escaping it electrifies the surrounding air, and
this, according to the law that &ldquo;like electricities repel each
other,&rdquo; has a reacting force on the wire arms. Accordingly
the windmill begins to turn, and may attain a tolerable rate
of speed if the tray is strongly charged.</p>

<p>Another amusing experiment is that known as the &ldquo;electrical
head of hair.&rdquo; The head of a wooden doll is taken,
and either provided with a real head of hair, which must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
combed out straight, or a quantity of cotton is fastened to
it to resemble hair.</p>

<p>If the head is fastened to a metal stand, and placed on the
tray when the excited paper is laid upon it, the hairs become
charged, and consequently repel each other, causing
the whole head of hair to stand erect, each hair separate
from the rest, thus presenting a most remarkable appearance.
For the same reason, if a heap of small pieces of paper,
feathers, etc., is laid on the tray, on placing upon it the
electrified paper they will jump off in all directions, each
being repelled by the others, in the same way as the gold
leaves of the electroscope were repelled in the first experiment.
If two pieces of pith are suspended by silk threads
to a support, so as to hang close to each other, on bringing
near them the electrified wax or tray they will be charged
and will repel each other for some time. If when charged
by the wax a heated glass rod rubbed with silk is brought
near to them, they will fly to it, instead of retreating. This
seems to indicate a difference between the electricities of the
wax and the glass, the former of which has therefore been
called negative, and the latter positive.</p>

<p>For giving stronger shocks than the tray is capable of, we
may have recourse to the apparatus known as the Leyden
jar, which may be easily charged by means of the tray and
excited paper. A Leyden jar is thus easily and cheaply constructed:
Take an ordinary wide-mouthed pickle bottle and
a cork to fit it. Cover the outside with tinfoil, which can be
fastened on with gum, and should be laid on as smoothly and
as free from creases as possible. Tinfoil can be procured
from any chemist. The outside being finished, the inside
has to be covered also, which is a work of greater difficulty.
It can best be performed by cutting another piece not quite
so large as that on the outside of the bottle but of the same
shape, and passing into the bottle without creasing it more
than can be helped, it can be arranged inside the bottle so
as to fit smoothly all round. Now a piece of brass wire is
to be passed through the cork, at the end of which is a brass
knob, or if simply bent round it will work, though the knob
is neater. At the end of the wire which is inside the bottle
a brass chain is fastened so as to touch the tinfoil inside the
bottle when the cork is inserted. The tinfoil inside and outside
the bottle must only reach to the bottom of the neck,
leaving a space between it and the cork.</p>

<p>The Leyden jar is now complete, and must be thoroughly
warmed before charging it. When quite hot it can be
charged by bringing the knob (the jar being held by the
outer coating of tinfoil) near the tray, when the excited
paper is laid upon it. A spark will pass between the tray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and the knob, and this must be repeated several times (say
twenty for a first experiment), the jar being charged more
fully the more sparks are put into it. Any one now taking
the jar in one hand by the outer coating and placing a finger
of the other hand near the knob will receive a shock, the
severity of which depends on the number of sparks put into
the jar. Several people can take the shock by joining
hands, the outside one on one side holding the jar, and
the outside one on the other side touching the knob.
Those in the middle will not feel the shock quite so strongly
as those on the outside.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i39.png" width="578" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;Bells Chimed by a Leyden Jar.</p>
</div>

<p>This is an example of the &ldquo;quick discharge&rdquo; of a Leyden
jar. It can, however, also be discharged slowly, and the
following experiment makes use of this faculty. Take three
small bells, which can be procured at any toy shop, and
remove the clappers. Now suspend two of them by wires at
opposite ends of a piece of metal or stout wire about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
inches long, and suspend this wire in the center by a bent
wire (or wooden, if covered with tinfoil) support, which is
fixed to a thick piece of board, covered with tinfoil, to act as
a base.</p>

<p>The tinfoil must be in communication with the supporting
wire, and the height of the bells must be so adjusted that
when the Leyden jar is placed between them with the third
bell supported on the knob (the support of the clapper will
have to be removed from the bell for this purpose), all three
bells will be of equal heights and about half an inch distant
from each other. (The diagram Fig. 2 will explain the arrangement.)
Now suspend two small brass buttons by silk
threads so as to hang between the bells when the Leyden
jar is placed in the center. Charge the jar with the tray and
replace it in position (of course with the bell on the top); the
buttons will then begin to move backwards and forwards
between the bells, and the latter will keep up a vigorous
chiming until the electricity of the jar is exhausted. In this
experiment it is essential that the supports be of metal, or
wood covered with tinfoil, as the electricity passes from the
inside of the jar to the outside while it is standing upon the
tinfoil, by means of the balls, and thus causes them to vibrate.</p>

<p>A candle which has just been blown out, leaving the wick
glowing, can easily be lighted by means of the charged Leyden
jar if a piece of bent wire is held touching the outer
coating and the other end on one side of the wick while the
knob is approached to the other, so that the spark passes
through the glowing wick. In the same way spirits of wine
can be lighted, and gunpowder, guncotton, etc., exploded. To
do this, it is best to have two pieces of bent wire provided with
handles of glass at the middle. These wires are held by the
handles, one in contact with the outer coating, and the other
with the inner coating, of the charged Leyden jar. On approaching
the other two ends of the wires a spark passes
between them, and if a small quantity of gunpowder is placed
on a table and the spark is made to pass through it by approaching
the wire to either side it will be fired.</p>

<p>There are many other experiments which can be performed
by the help of the simple apparatus described, but it would
take up too much space to describe them.</p>

<p>Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as
possible. Some changes have been made. They are listed below.</p>

<p>The format used for fractions in the original, where 1 1-4
represents 1¼, has been changed to the latter.</p>

<p>In the chapter "How to Make an Induction Coil," a section heading
"PART I." was removed as there is no "PART II."</p>

<p>The following is a list of changes made to the original.
The first line is the original line, the second the corrected one.</p>
